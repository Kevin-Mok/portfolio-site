# AGENTS-BASE.md (Deprecated)

This file is retained as a compatibility shim.

Canonical runtime policy now lives in:

1. `AGENTS.md` (shared baseline)
2. `AGENTS.repo.md` (repository-specific additions)
3. `AGENTS.override.local.md` (optional local stricter-only additions)

If these files conflict, follow the precedence above.

For non-trivial work, follow ExecPlan guidance in `.agent/PLANS.md` and store plans in `plans/<task-slug>.md`.
