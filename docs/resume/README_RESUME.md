## Common Tasks Quick Links

### Update Your Resume
1. Open `lib/resume-data.ts`
2. Update `resumeVariants` entries for the variants you maintain:
   - Contact info
   - Projects array
   - Experience array
   - Skills array plus optional `skillsBold` / `skillsHtmlLines` formatting controls
   - Education array
3. Test on `/resume`
4. Regenerate PDFs
5. Run layout checks (`npm run verify:resume-layout` then `npm run validate-resume-pdfs`) and tune page fill if needed
6. Commit changes

**Full guide**: [RESUME_MAINTENANCE.md § Updating Resume Content](./RESUME_MAINTENANCE.md#updating-resume-content)

### Add New Project
1. Add entry to the target variant's `projects` array in `resumeVariants` (`lib/resume-data.ts`)
2. Include: name, url, languages, date, bullets
3. Test on `/resume`
4. Add PDF variant if creating new focused resume

**Full guide**: [RESUME_MAINTENANCE.md § Adding a New Project](./RESUME_MAINTENANCE.md#adding-a-new-project)

### Regenerate PDFs
1. Run build-time generator:

```bash
npm run build
```

`npm run generate-resume-pdfs` now skips unchanged variants automatically and regenerates only changed/missing PDFs.

2. Validate one-page/page-fill/font constraints:

```bash
npm run verify:resume-layout
```

```bash
npm run validate-resume-pdfs
```

3. If validation fails, run auto-calibration (`npm run calibrate:resume-layout`) or manually adjust per-variant print controls (`--resume-print-scale`, `--resume-print-leading`, `--resume-print-top-offset`) in `app/styles/13-resume-latex.css`, regenerate, and re-run validation.
4. Verify regenerated files in `public/resume/`
5. Commit changes

**Full guide**: [RESUME_MAINTENANCE.md § Regenerating PDFs](./RESUME_MAINTENANCE.md#regenerating-pdfs)

### Add New PDF Variant
1. Add variant content in `resumeVariants` (`lib/resume-data.ts`)
2. Add matching generator entry in `scripts/lib/resume-pdf-variants.mjs`
3. Run:

```bash
npm run generate-resume-pdfs
```

4. Test dropdown and download
5. Commit changes

**Full guide**: [RESUME_MAINTENANCE.md § Managing PDF Variants](./RESUME_MAINTENANCE.md#managing-pdf-variants)

### Change Resume Colors
1. Edit `app/styles/13-resume-latex.css`
2. Update colors in selectors like `.entry-title`, `.entry-tech`, etc.
3. Test on `/resume` and different themes
4. Commit changes

**Full guide**: [RESUME_MAINTENANCE.md § Styling Customization](./RESUME_MAINTENANCE.md#styling-customization)

### Test Changes
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Click "Resume" in sidebar or polybar
3. Navigate to `/resume`
4. Test responsive design (resize browser)
5. Test PDF download with different variants
6. Switch themes (Tokyo Night, Nord, Solarized)

**Full guide**: [RESUME_MAINTENANCE.md § Testing Changes](./RESUME_MAINTENANCE.md#testing-changes)

### Generate Resume-Ready README Points (ChatGPT)
1. Open the prompt guide:

```text
docs/prompts/README_RESUME_POINTS_PROMPT.md
```

2. Attach the listed files and run the prompt in ChatGPT
3. Review returned unified diffs for factual accuracy
4. Apply diffs in each target project repo

**Prompt guide**: [README_RESUME_POINTS_PROMPT.md](../prompts/README_RESUME_POINTS_PROMPT.md)

### Restructure Resume Variants From README Points (ChatGPT)
1. Open the prompt guide:

```text
docs/prompts/RESUME_VARIANT_RESTRUCTURE_PROMPT.md
```

2. Attach all files listed in the prompt doc (including all paths from `docs/archive/UPDATED_README_PATHS.md`)
3. Run the prompt and review unified diffs for `lib/resume-data.ts` (and `app/styles/13-resume-latex.css` only if needed)
4. Run validation commands and resolve all failures before merging:
   - `npm run build`
   - `npm run verify:resume-layout`
   - `npm run validate-resume-pdfs`

**Prompt guide**: [RESUME_VARIANT_RESTRUCTURE_PROMPT.md](../prompts/RESUME_VARIANT_RESTRUCTURE_PROMPT.md)
