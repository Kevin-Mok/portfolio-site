# GitHub Profile Bio + Repo Metadata (portfolio-site)

## Objective
- Write a GitHub bio with an immediate hiring hook for Junior Web Developer roles, tied to this repository.
- Provide repo `About` text and `Topics` for this portfolio project.
- Add emoji while keeping it professional.
- Add an 80-character status with emoji that reflects active work in `portfolio-site`.

## Final Outputs
Bio:
```text
💼 Seeking Junior Web Dev roles | Building portfolio-site (Next.js/TS) | Ex-Cloud Engineer Intern @ Red Hat | Linux/FOSS evangelist | CS @ UofT
```

Status (80-char target):
```text
👀 Building portfolio-site daily with React, Next.js, Node, Linux, and OSS🚀
```

Repo About:
```text
Personal portfolio site built with Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind. Showcases projects, resume variants, and production-minded frontend engineering.
```

Repo Topics:
```text
portfolio, nextjs, react, typescript, tailwindcss, web-development, frontend, app-router, resume, open-source
```

## Rationale
- The first words are job-search focused so recruiters instantly see hiring intent.
- `portfolio-site` is named early to connect hiring intent with a live project and relevant stack.
- Red Hat + Linux/FOSS + CS @ UofT were kept to show credible experience, technical identity, and current academic foundation.
- Emoji use is minimal and intentional to add visibility without making the profile feel casual.
