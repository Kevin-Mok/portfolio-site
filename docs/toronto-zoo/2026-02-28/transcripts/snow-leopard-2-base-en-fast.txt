I have no idea where they went. I thought movement would be too straight. It might be over there, but Last track of where they went. Yeah, that's pretty much enrichment for them. So they got all these climbing structures. They can climb on we give them. I saw a rain bale in there. They got new enrichment late last year. It's like a wobble tour like a big wobble toy with a pole. They broke it immediately, which is so fun for us. Oh yeah, it's pretty much like they're big on set. Yeah. Do we have any final questions before I head on out? I'm not gonna lie to my coworkers last day and there's a takeaway in front of me back at the office. He's not leaving the zoo. James, he's going back to the zoo mode. But today's his last day in Wilding County. So we've got Ken Burgh, he's the male. So he's the one you're not seeing. We got Jito, she's the mom. We got Joia and Niki. Yes, they're the ones that are right here. Also, we're like, except for that guy. But yeah. How do you spell their name? And soon we don't have an exact date yet. So there's no date. But, um, because I think it keeps getting pushed because of the border and stuff. So, um, I think that was like the original, like, Time frame, but yeah, unfortunately with all that there's no like we don't have a set date yet, but there with Pember's change of plan Yes, yeah, yeah What they all so pember yeah I know, but I like this right? M-I-N-U. Me-N-U. Thank you. I know once I said I'm like always wrong. So at this moment plans have changed constantly. So by the time you come back something could have changed because it's already changed from last time I did this talk. Pemma's going back to Calgary. No date yet. And then there are two cubs, Zoya and Minas. I don't know better. They're going... I have no idea what their habitat looks like there so I can't say better or worse but... the space here, but we only move animals to other accredited zoos. So we're all accredited with a ZA. So I would, I would assume their habitat is good enough to have to have them for, especially for them to be in accredited zoo. So I personally, so then possibly better if we're just renovated, but I can't say yes or no, if it is a better habitat, but it's like needed anyway, because they they need to go somewhere. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cuz yeah, we don't have the space for three separate groups because if we were to keep all of them it'd be like pembroke one group Cubs in this group and Jita in this group. Yeah, that's a lot Yeah, so it's easier They go off to another zoo and then they can be a potential Yeah part of the breeding program over there with a new way. So you guys have bread? Yeah, so we've got yeah, we've had the we had pembroke and Jita and they bread last year and had the group or two years ago now, I guess had the cubs. Yeah. Okay. And then, um, and it is how they're endangered, like levels. They are endangered. I'm pretty sure there's about three to 6,000 of them left in the wild. Okay. But that's mostly due to like habitat loss. Less. Less than that. Less now? I think. Well, yeah, the numbers are constantly changing. They're so elusive. Yeah, but yeah, there's a number I saw was three to six thousand but yeah around there. Yeah, oh there they go All right, but yeah, I do have to run thank you guys for coming No, yeah, because last time I did this it was G-deleaving but If the girls didn't get the papers, they would stay with mum then. Yeah, they're at a certain point. I think if the paperwork isn't, yeah, they'd be separated. So also, the pambo would be gone. So we would kind of do what we're doing with pambo. But the final plan for now, which could change. Because like I said, from the last time I did the talk to now, it has changed. It was G-delieving, not pambelieving. But it's always been the cups are going to act once. I don't think that changing it just when we can't. Probably. Yeah, we're just doing so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Drive them over. Yeah. But yeah. Thanks so much for coming. Thank you. Have you come next Saturday? Probably going to be me again. And so is anyone need be gone by then? No. No. I think so. Yeah. This talk and it's always going to be a wild encounter. Stop doing Saturday. It's not like we're talking. So while encounters at least until March 9th. It's going to be us doing the Tuesday goat talk and the Saturday snow up a talk. And then I think every other one should be a keeper. If they remember because we've had some instances. I've heard where the keepers forget. But I'm not going to lie that James forget about the goat one on Tuesday and not go. Yes. So it's also want us to re-forget to. So I can't I forgot this one a couple weeks ago too. So I can't Thank you, I like it. Yeah, hope you guys enjoy.
