Do you have a question? So unfortunately Jita is that like the bottom of the list for optional female? Remember however, she knows about the very topic. Yes, Jizz, I believe these clubs are the only clubs you've ever had. So his genes are valuable. Unfortunately for us, Pamba is going back to Calgary Zoo Zoo. We don't have a set date, but the Calgary Zoo, that's his home. There's no effort and they apparently just built a wonderful solar for time. So eventually, tambour is going to move back to Calgary and then we also don't have a set time with all the fun borders stuff that's happening right now but the cubs, both of them are going to go to iPhone 2 in a bit. I forget where iPhone 2 is somewhere in the gate. So they'll both go there and we'll have D. There. Unfortunately, all the time being, We have for a bit. But if we happen to get a new male and female here. Future of personnel efforts. If you come here next year or this time. We will possibly only have D. But. So they've got their solitary animals. They'd like to be by themselves. That's right. And then the cops they around this time maybe over older. We always will have their comments with the mom until usually on the wild they start to separate so they'll It'll be I think summer ice will be the earliest time, but I guess I was all the border stuff and what's happening down there There might be a pause on that moving but Yeah, any other questions? I can just start talking about Where are they moving to so? Remember our mail going to Calgary and then the two cubs are going to Aquan Zoo which is in the States and I can't remember where that is but Aquan Zoo a.k.r.o.n I think That sounds right. Yes, I think if I wasn't saying a while that's probably I almost failed I'm a science person. I'm not geography. I don't know So they can live up to around 18 to 20 so Pembers kind of like with like places at the moment and then yeah, Jita still a young still that word being at four She's she's got some time to wear that but yeah, and then the cops are perfectly fine there turning to a fun thing about there I believe it's one of the comforts born late May 13th and then the other cub was born early on the 14th and then jiddos birthday is on the 15th and then pamos birthday is on the 16th but a view so we almost had it all in order Pemojis had to ruin it by being the most favorite but they usually the female so cycle in February so that's why the cubs usually have birthdays like And then sometimes it's last until June like come up, but that's usually where for them to have birthdays in June Most know that for it you'll see our born in May. They've got May birth. Oh, I see I saw a tail coming up. I think feel like about the case you might be able to see one coming There we go. I had to tell them apart She's the biggest. She's the mom. I'm not gonna lie, I am awful at telling these guys apart. If I can only see one, who knows? I wanna say that's probably one of the cubs just because I think she don't will be stuck inside. Hemba, but to tell them apart if you can see their face, they've got a bunch of dots on their forehead. Oh, there we go. We knew also on her back you guys know monster energy she kind of has the logo on her back I don't think that'll happen I would just want to have the monster I know I haven't seen a single one of them. They're great at camouflage. You've probably seen the photos online where it's like five spots that's no longer than just walkie and snowy. You can't see them at all. They're also great hunters. I guess not great, but they have their own way of hunting. So they'll hunt pretty much these guys right behind us, the West Caucasian turn. Instead of tackling them outside of the cliff. They just push them off the clip and then they take the walk down. That's pretty much how they do it. But they do have massive parts to help with their timing at the very steep, the size that they live on. They're so cute. They're so cute. For their diets. So they're diets. So here we feed them ground meat and since they're kids, they want specifically for what animals. But it's a farm animal and it's not cow or pig or he and they say name. So we feed them that animal, such as it's a lot leaner and they're closer to what they would eat out in the wild. Pember however, does not like that. So it's what we call the feedline diet. It's that ground up meat with some vitamins and nutrients added to it. Pember said, I don't like that, don't give it to me. He wants what we feed the polar bears. He gets the polar bear diet, which is quite laterally, Just that feline diet with some added fat to it. You just want more of the fat ear food. And then they'll get quail. Sometimes we'll give them some quail. They also got strips of said animal that I won't say because it's children. And hopefully no one owns those animals here because I've also had that in the fat diet. That's pretty much what we feed them here. They have out here. Like here or down the wild. Here. So we give them like, so typically, hopefully it's snowy. Like in the winter, obviously snowy. But there's no snow. It's pretty much all rocky. We give them all the climbing circles. This number, we're actually going to put a cooling pad in there. For the African and most of the lions in the hyenas, in caves they have those are heated so that's how they can be in here and they can idea winters and our summer we're going to put cooling pad in there so hopefully they'll stay out longer on the summer but we always give these guys access inside when it gets a bit too warm for them so they can choose to be in the air conditioning or be out here so hopefully that cooling pad helps with them relaxing out here but we'll we'll see Depending on how cool it can get I know myself I would prefer the air conditioning It's the same with our polar bears our polar bears have 24 hour access inside and it's air conditioned inside all the time so Typically in the summer they'll be inside But yeah, I don't cool to see how they fare with With their cooling pattern there Should they do that many tippies? Not really these She does her pretty fine. They don't... If anything, we do. She... She likes to... We think it for attention. Because once it keeps her comes out, she stops it. But she'll start playing with the mesh. And obviously we don't want her doing that. But she'll start playing with it. And she won't stop until the keeper shows up. Once the keeper shows up, she's like, oh, you're here, wonderful. That's pretty much the only thing like kind of behavior like that. They do, other than that. They're basically big house cats, they sleep for much more days. They don't want to go in with them. Like a house cat, you don't want to come up with them because they're not involved for you. No, so these cats, they only large cats that don't make any of that noise. So they're vocalizations, they're just like, some purrs and kind of like a low growl, but they can't like war like a lot. They can only make like very quiet noises which helps with their hunting. They're very stealthy. It looks so thin. It's I don't know the exact material like it is like a metal fence. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think on the top it's like a rope. Material. But yeah the side is I'm pretty sure metal mesh. We have to have it fully enclosed. Okay, these guys, I can't remember the exact height, but they have like an insane jump. And if we didn't have it in close, they could just hop right out. And obviously, we're kind of cool, but we don't want that. We call this here if you were safe in a bubble. It'd be fun, but yeah, so that's why they're have touch fully enclosed. You don't have that fun day here at the zoo. So, well, okay, if I've been stressed, these guys have done. These guys perfectly fine with it. They're like sure whatever. I don't even know if they notice. Have a nice one. No problem. Not that is stress is the note, but these guys, me personally, I've only really know some of Pamba. Okay, that's typically like what they see out in the wild. That's why we separate our animals zujiographically. They'll base off where they're from in the wild. Just so that they can get like the sights on this mold that they would typically get in the wild. But then with these guys we can also protect the habitat. So the animals they grow full winter coat and then in the spring they start to lose it. If you guys come back in the summer completely different animals there they're like completely bald not completely bald but very much less hair but we can take some of that hair spread it in their habitat so they can like hunt for a camel without us traumatizing all you guys and putting a putting an actual camel in there which would not be fun for anyone especially the keepers who would have to clean up after that but yeah just
