And Aurora and Nikita were doing the other side. There's the brother and sister kept together and then the two sisters are together. Morning there names. This is Juneau and then Hudson is inside and then Aurora and Nikita are on the other side. Okay. Did you spell their names? Yeah, it's just here. If you want to take a picture. Or or an a kita are like once we want to twin and then Aurora is the mother to Hudson Humphrey and Juno Hudson and Juno still live here and Humphrey moved to another zoo. Where did Humphrey go? I'm not totally sure it's either grandi or It's online for sure you can find but I'm not So this is kind of like a more encouraged area. They experience like any kind of tip-beats. No, they do have larger areas that they have and they rotate. How often do they rotate? I'm not sure for the polar bears at least on today. Some of our animals I know more about like that right thing rotate three times a day. True and the gorillas rotate twice. If they're one today it's awesome. So these guys I'm not quite sure. The brother and sister have been in here since I thought here as well. But their day is only like eight hours. Yeah, and then they move into the inside where they have more areas to. So is it like how big is there indoor area? I'm not sure. I've never seen it. But it is big enough for all four of them to be. It's all climate controlled. So it's all be pretty cool. What's the normal? We did live in condition by degrees. So I think we can get as low as minus 40 Celsius. And then is that like a normal day? What's the normal day? I'm not sure. I love this bit. I was just thinking that it's easier to do it. What's an E-seize right there? Sorry? They're just polar bears, like is there any specific species here or anything? Uh, no, just polar bear. Um... Yeah, it just says it's minus 40 for much of the year. Is there any interest in anything? Oh! Oh, well, where's the hat? Where is that, yeah. Some people usually manage this food or well. Almost all these volunteers are around. I'm so curious, you're volunteering. Yeah, this station is only... ...Oven Sansek, I usually found between the America's Pavilion where the waters are. We talked about conservation and the wildlife healthcare center is quite life working in. So what is the ask for? Like how is the volunteer process? Well you have to apply and then you go through 10 weeks of training. And then mentoring sessions where you go out with the long-term volunteers who have been here for a while and they train you more. How like what it was the process like the other ask you questions and how was that? The interview process was pretty chill they just kind of make sure that you really want to be doing it and that you can commit the time to it but what like what do you know about my brain's app with the app? No it's they ask like situational questions of what would you do if this happened kind of thing but it's nothing too difficult you just apply online I work from home. I'm a remote worker in the whole time. So I just did it to get out of the house a bit more. Talk to people. How long is it like to shift? Each shift is about three hours. It's pretty reasonable. Yeah, and they're all over the zoo. Lots of different stuff to talk about for sure. You get the golden different marks on your own. Yeah, you can only do the same thing one time for a month. So I can't read at this table again. Well, that's the end of February, but I couldn't have been at this table again in February before. That's pretty cool, so I like rotate you in a day long. Yeah, and I only work two times a month, so it's pretty easy for me not to overlap. But the third I can take a little time every week or twice a week. All right, thanks. You know what I'm like this week.
