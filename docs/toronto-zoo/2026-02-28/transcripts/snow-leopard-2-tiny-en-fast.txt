I have no idea where they went. I thought moving into the beach there. They might be over there, but last track of where they went. Yeah, that's pretty much enrichment for them. So they got all these climbing structures. They can climb on. We give them. I saw a rain bill in there. They got new enrichment late last year. It's like a wobble to it. Like a big wobble to it with a pull. They broke it immediately. Which is so fun for us. So yeah, it's true. Yeah, big on set. Yeah. If we have any final questions before I head on out, I'm not going to lie to my coworkers last day and it's take waiting for me. I can't be off. So he's not leaving the zoo. The James before I'm back to the zoo. But today's is that same while I've been found this. So we got a time for him. He's the male. So he's the one you're not seeing. We got Jida, she's the mom. We got Joya and Mimi. Yeah, they're the ones that are actually. Oh, for them. Except for them. How do you spell their name? Soon we don't have a exact date yet. So there's no date. But because I think it keeps getting pushed because of the border and stuff. So I think that was like the original like time frame but yeah unfortunately with all that there's no like we don't have a set date yet but there. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. But I like this area. But yeah, I actually I want to go see him in October. Yeah, well, yeah. Sorry, you had one final question. Yeah, how do you spell their name? The briefly what's happening each of them going away. So and yeah. Yeah, so Pember is P-E-M-B-A. Yeah, J-I-T-A. Zoya Z-O-Y-A. Me, new? Oh no. And you mean you yes, and you mean you thank you I know once I said I'm like always wrong So at this moment plans have changed constantly so By the time you come back something could have changed because it's already changed from last time I did this talk Pember's going back to Calgary no date yet and then the two cubs joya and mean I don't know better. They're going I have no idea what their have to look like there. So I can't say better or worse, but Because they were grown already so the mom they have to leave Yeah, at some point I took two years old mom will kick them out. Yeah, so we do and we don't have But we only move animals to other accredited zoos. So while accredited with AZA, so I would assume they're habitats good enough to have them, especially for them to be an accredited zoo. So I personally, so them possibly better if it was renovated, but I can't say yes or no if it is a better habitat, but it's like needed anyway because they need to go somewhere. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we don't have this face for three separate groups because if we were to keep all of them, it'd be like Pembo one group comes in this group in Gita in this group. Yeah, it's a lot of it. Yeah, so it's easier. They go off to another zoo and then they can be a potential, yeah, part of the breeding program over there with a new. So you guys have bred yet. So we've got, yeah, we've had the we had Pembo and Gita and they bred last year. and had their two years ago now I guess had the cubs. Yeah. Okay. And then, and then is how they're endangered like levels. They are endangered. I'm pretty sure there's about three to six thousand of them left in the wild. Okay. But that's mostly due to like habitat loss. Less now? I think. Well, yeah, the numbers are constantly changing. They're so elusive. Yeah, but yeah, that's the number I saw was three to six thousand, but yeah around there. Yeah, who there they go? All right, but yeah, I do have to run. Thank you guys for coming. Thank you. No, yeah, cuz that's how I do this it would G.D. leaving but sure who no yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I present the girls didn't get the papers they would stay with mum then. Yeah, they'll. At a certain point I think if the paperwork isn't yet they'd be separated so hopefully Pember would be gone so we would kind of do what we're doing with Pember but the final plan for now which could change because like I said from the last time I did the talk to now it has changed it was redeveloping not to Pember leaving but it was always been the I don't think that changing. It's just when we came out. Probably yeah, I would assume so. Yeah, yeah, drive them over. Yeah. But yeah, thanks so much for coming. Thank you. Have you come next Saturday? Are they going to be me again? It's so it's anyone need to be gone by then. No, I think so. Yeah, this talk and it's always going to be a while encounter. I'm not gonna lie to James forget about the goat one on Tuesday and not go yet so it's also on us to read we forget to so I can't I forgot this one a couple weeks to go to so I can't Yeah, hope you guys are dry.
