And we're in the Sita work time. So where's it? Where's the one that's out? She is just around the corner there and then her brother went inside for now. Yeah. Is this you do a one right here? There is the brother and sister, shet the other and then the two sisters are together. More than their names. This is Juno and then Hudson is inside and then Aurora and Lake Kida are on the other side. Okay. She's better than her name. Yeah, she's here. Oh, take a picture. Turned on or on a kita or like once they win the twins and then Aurora is the mother to put in Humphrey and Juno's still live here in Humphrey move to another zoo where the Humphrey go I'm not totally sure it's either grandi or It's all mine This is kind of like a mornin' urge to help you to be experienced like any cold or a chickpeas. You guys are out on the street? No, they do have larger areas that they have and they rotate. I'll convey, okay. I'm not very sure for the Golden Bears at most of the day. Some of our animals I know more about like the right change rotate three times a day through and the gorillas rotate twice. If they're one today, it's awesome. So these guys I'm not quite sure. The brother and sister have been in here since I thought here at 12. But their days only like days early. Yeah, and then they move into the inside where they have more areas too. So is it like how big is their indoor area? I'm not sure. I've never seen it. But it is big and overall for them to be. It's all time. It's all time. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all. It's all.

Just as it's minus one for much of the year. Is there any interesting? Some people usually man this or well This station is only open to a time where I usually found between America's pavilion where the water is on. The wild life care center is quite like working in. Yeah. chill. They just kind of make sure that you really want to be doing it and that you can commit the time to it. But what like what you know my great dad has or just know. No it's they ask like situational questions of what would you do if this happened kind of thing. But it's nothing to different just apply online. I work from home. I'm a remote worker. Full time. So I just do it to get out of the house a bit more. Talk to people. How long does he like to shift him? Each shift is about three hours. It's pretty really long. Yeah, and they're all over the zoo. Lots of different stuff to talk about. You get to go to different countries. Yeah, you can only do the same thing one time for a month. So I can't be at this table again. Let's see if I'm very bad. I couldn't have been at this table again in February or before. That's pretty cool. It's like a rotate unit. Yeah, and I only work two times a month, so it's pretty easy. I mean, not too. Overlap. That's a third up. I'm going to give you a comment every week or twice a week. All right, thanks.
