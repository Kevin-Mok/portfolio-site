So these guys are part of their breeding program. There's no upper breeding program within Dus. Gdas D have been used so much, not per specific. So unfortunately Jita is at the bottom of the list for our optional female. Pember however, is that the very top? I believe these cubs are the only cubs he's ever had. So his genes are valuable. Unfortunately for us Pember is going back to Kaguizu. We don't have a set date but Kaguizu, that's his home. There's no effort and they apparently just built a wonderful snow leopard habitat. So eventually, Humber is going to move back to Calgary and then we also don't have a set time with all the fun border stuff that's happening right now but the cubs, both of them are going to go to I-Fun-Zoo in a bit. I forget where I-Fun-Zoo is somewhere in the States. So they'll both go there and we'll have V-Day here. So unfortunately, for the time being, We have for a bit but if we happen to get a new male and female here And then the cubs, they, around this time, maybe a little bit older, definitely the more anyways. So we always will have the cubs with them on until usually out in the wild, they've got this upgrade. So they'll, it'll be, I think, summer-ish, will be the earliest time, but I can't stop with all the border stuff and what's happening down there. There might be a pause on them moving, but Right yeah any other questions I can just start talking about Where are they moving to so? Remember our mail going to Calgary and then the two cubs are going to Akwan Zoo Which is in the States and I can't remember where that is but Akwan Zoo a kr-o-n I think That sounds right. Yes, I think if I want saying oh while that's probably it. I almost failed I'm a science person. I'm not geography. I don't know So they can live up to around 18 to 20 so tempos kind of like Midlife places at the moment and then yeah, Jita's still a young snow leopard being at four She's she's got some time to her that's right. Yeah, and then the cubs are perfectly fine there turn into a fun thing about their birthday I believe it One of the cubs was born late May 13th and then the other cub was born early on the 14th and then she does birthday is on the 15th And then pamma's birthday is on the 16th but of you So we almost had it all in order pamma just had to ruin it by being a month later But they usually the female cycle in February so that's why the cubs usually have birthdays like End of April and then Sometimes it lasts until June like come up, but that's usually rare for them to have birthdays in June Most no-lapse words you'll see are born in May. They've got May birthdays. Oh, I see I saw a tail coming up I think feel like above the cave you might be able to see one coming There we go. I had to tell them apart She's the biggest. She's the mom. I'm not gonna lie, I am awful at telling these guys apart. If I can only see one, who knows? I wanna say that's probably one of the cubs just because I think she will be not beside Hemba. But to tell them apart, if you can see their face, they've got a bunch of dots on their forehead. Oh, there we go. Me knew also on her back you guys know monster energy she kind of has a logo on her back I don't think that'll happen I was just about to have some monster I haven't seen a single one of them, or we all want them there too. They're great at camouflage. You've probably seen the photos online, which like tried to spot the snow leopard and just rocky and snowy. You can't see them at all. They're also great hunters. I guess not great, but they have their own way of hunting. So they'll hunt pretty much these guys right behind us, the West Caucasian Turf. Instead of tackling them off the side of the cliff, They just push them off the cliff and then they safely walk down But they do have massive pods to help with their climbing at the very steep the sites that they live on They're so cute So they're diets so here we feed them ground meat and since they're kids I won't specifically say wet animals right so far my animal and in a top tower pig or she, and they say name. So we feed them that animal, just as it's a lot leaner, and it's closer to what they would eat out in the wild. Pember, however, does not like that. So it's what we call the feline diet, it's that ground up meat with some vitamins and nutrients added to it. Pember said, I don't like that, don't give it to me. He wants what we feed the polar bears. He gets the polar bear diet, which is quite literally, Just that feline diet with some added fat to it. He just wants more of the fattier food. And then they'll get quail. Sometimes we'll give them some quail. They also got strips of said animal that I won't say because they're still good. And hopefully no one owns those animals here because I've also had that in the set for Mexico. But that's pretty much what we feed them here. So what kind of a substrate like here or down the wild? Um here. So we give them like so typically hopefully it's snowy like in the winter obviously snowy um when there's no snow it's pretty much all walking um we give them all the time we cut those off. We're actually gonna put a cooling pad in there uh for the African animals are like the lions and the hyenas the rocks in caves they have those are heated so that's how they can be in here in the Canadian winters and our summers we're gonna put a cooling pad in there so hopefully they'll stay out longer in the summers but we always give these guys access inside when it gets a bit too warm for them so they can choose to be in the air conditioning or be out here so hopefully that cooling pad helps with them relaxing out here but we'll we'll see Depending on how cool it can get, I know myself I would prefer the air condition. It's the same with our polar bears. Our polar bears have 24-hour access inside and it's air conditioned inside all the time. So typically in the summer they'll be inside. But yeah, it'll cool to see how they fare with their cooling pad in there. Do they have any tippies? Not really. I think that's her pretty fine. They don't, if anything, Midu, she likes to, we think it for attention. Because once a keeper comes out, she stops it. But she'll start playing with the mesh. And obviously we don't want her doing that. But she'll start playing with it. And she won't stop until the keeper shows up. And once the keeper shows up, she's like, oh, you're here, wonderful. That's pretty much the only like kind of behavior like that. They do other than that. They're basically big house cats. They sleep for much of a day. They'll just, you don't want to go in with them. Like a house cat. You don't want to cut it with them because that we're not involved for you. No, so these guys, they're the only large cat that don't make any of that noise. So their vocalizations are just like, kind of purrs and kind of like a low growl, but they can't like war like a They can only make very quiet noises which helps with their hunting. They're very stealthy. It looks so thin. I don't know the exact nature. It is like a metal fence. I think that on the top it's a rope behavior material. But yeah, the side is a metal fence. pretty sure metal mesh. We have to have it fully enclosed. These guys, I can't remember the exact height, but they have an insane jump. And if we didn't have it enclosed, they could just hop right out. And obviously, would be kind of cool, but we don't want that. It'd be cool to see if you were safe in a bubble. It'd be fun, but yeah, so that's why they have to have fully enclosed. I don't have that fun day here at the zoo. So, well, okay, if I've been stressed, these guys don't. These guys perfectly fine with it. They're like, sure, whatever. I don't even know if they notice. Have a nice one. No problem. Not that it stresses them out, but these guys, me personally, I've only really noticed them with Pemba. They're like this set up a window there. for them. That's typically what they see out in the wild. That's why we separate our animals zoo geographically. They're based off where they're from in the wild. Just so that they can get the sight sounds and smells. That they were typically getting the wild. But then with these guys, we can also put them into their habitat. So the camels, they grow full winter coat and then in the spring they start to lose it. If you guys come back in the summer completely different animals there they're like completely bald not completely bald but very much less hair very much less hair but we can take some of that hair spread it in their habitat so they can like hunt for a camel without us traumatizing all you guys and putting a putting an actual camel in there which would not be fun for anyone especially the keepers who would have to clean up after that right yeah just
