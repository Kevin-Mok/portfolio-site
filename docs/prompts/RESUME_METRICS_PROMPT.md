Here is the refined **"Strategic HR-Lead" Prompt**.

This version is specifically designed to bridge the gap between high-level engineering and HR's focus on **business value, productivity, and scalability.**

# Prompt: The Strategic HR-Lead Engine

**Role:** You are a Senior Technical Career Consultant and a Hiring Manager. Your goal is to translate complex codebase files into **high-impact resume bullets** that satisfy both technical lead reviews and HR/Recruiter screening.

**Task:** Generate 10 resume points for this project using the **Action + Tech + Human-Readable Result** formula.

### 1. The "HR-Friendly" Metric Rules

Every bullet point **must** include a realistic, impressive numeric metric. If the code doesn’t explicitly state a number, use "Senior-Level" industry benchmarks.

### 2. The Style Constraints (The "F-Pattern" Scan)

* **Bolding Rule:** Bold only the **Action Verb**, the **Primary Tech**, and the **Numeric Outcome**. Do not bold entire sentences.
* **Tone:** Professional and "Senior-Level Clear." Use sophisticated language (e.g., *Architected*, *Orchestrated*, *Centralized*) that remains accessible to non-engineers.
* **Focus:** Connect the "Code" to the "Business Why." (Example: Instead of saying "Optimized images," say "Automated dynamic marketing assets to increase click-through rates by **40%**").

### 3. Output Format (Strictly follow this order):

1. **Executive Project Summary:** (2 lines) High-level overview of the problem solved, the **tech stack** used, and the overall business impact (e.g., "streamlining user acquisition").
2. **Tech Stack:** (Single comma-separated line).
3. **The Bullet Bank:** (10 bullets).
* *Example:* "**Architected** a tiered membership portal using **Next.js**, reducing customer onboarding time by **35%** and eliminating manual access management."


4. **Top 5 "HR-Ready" Bullets:** Select the 5 strongest bullets that clearly show you saved the company time, made them money, or improved the user experience.
5. **ATS Keyword Pack:** (15 keywords). A mix of "Hard Tech" and "Process/Business" terms (e.g., **Scalable Architecture**, **Conversion Rate Optimization**, **Performance Tuning**).

**Now, analyze the attached files and produce the output.**

### Why this prompt is superior for your needs:

* **It creates "Social Proof":** By framing your technical hooks (`useCountUp.ts`) as tools for "increasing brand trust," it tells HR you understand how users think.
* **It emphasizes "Automation":** HR loves candidates who "eliminate manual work." This prompt forces the AI to highlight how your code saves the company labor hours.
* **Optimized for the 6-Second Scan:** By bolding the **Action**, **Tech**, and **Number**, a recruiter can understand your entire value proposition without reading a single full sentence.

**Would you like me to run this specific prompt on your files one last time to give you the perfect "HR-Ready" output?**
