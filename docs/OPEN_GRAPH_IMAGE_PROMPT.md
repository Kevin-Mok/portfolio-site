# ChatGPT Prompt: Open Graph Image (With Headshot)

Use this prompt in ChatGPT (with image generation enabled).  
Upload this headshot first: `public/images/profile/kevin-red-hat.jpg`

## Copy/Paste Prompt

```text
You are a senior brand designer creating a social preview image for my personal portfolio site.

Use the attached headshot as the primary subject (do not replace the face, do not stylize into a different person). Keep the face natural and recognizable.

Design goal:
- Premium, modern, technical personal brand
- Confident but clean
- Suitable for software engineering / AI systems audience

OpenGraph.xyz recommendations to follow:
1) Canvas size must be exactly 1200 x 630 px (1.91:1).
2) Keep important content (face, name, title) centered with generous safe margins to avoid platform cropping.
3) Prefer high-clarity JPG/PNG output compatibility and keep visual complexity reasonable.
4) Keep text concise and readable at small preview size.

Composition requirements:
- Use my headshot as the hero element.
- Dark, high-contrast background with subtle gradient.
- Add a soft overlay behind text for readability.
- Keep typography bold and clean.
- Place text in a center-safe area.

Text to include:
- Kevin Mok
- Software Engineer
- TypeScript • React • Node.js • AI Systems
- kevin-mok.com

Color direction:
- Background: deep navy / charcoal tones
- Accent: cyan / teal highlights
- Text: white and light gray

Output requirements:
- Return final image at exactly 1200 x 630.
- Export-ready for og:image usage.
- Also provide one alternate variation with slightly different text placement, same dimensions.
```

## Optional Refinement Prompt

```text
Create 3 variations with the same 1200x630 size:
1) Photo-left / text-right
2) Full-bleed photo with dark gradient overlay and centered text
3) Minimal layout with smaller headshot card and strong typography

Keep all critical text inside center-safe area and preserve my facial likeness.
```
